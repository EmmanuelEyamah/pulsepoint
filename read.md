PulsePoints: Blood Donation Management System
Introduction

PulsePoints is a web-based blood donation management system designed to connect hospitals in urgent need of blood with nearby volunteer donors. The system aims to bridge the gap between supply and demand by leveraging location-based notifications and streamlined communication.

Core Features

Hospital Registration

Hospitals create accounts on the platform.

Each hospital manages its profile and posts blood requests.

Blood Request Posting

Hospitals can publish urgent or scheduled requests for specific blood types.

Requests include details such as type of blood needed, urgency level, and hospital location.

Volunteer/Donor Accounts

Individuals register as donors on the platform.

Donors provide their basic details, blood group, and contact information.

Location-Based Notifications

When a hospital posts a blood request, donors within a defined radius (e.g., 5–10 km) receive notifications.

Donors can view request details and head to the hospital to donate.

Communication & Coordination

Donors get real-time updates on hospital needs.

Hospitals can track which requests are fulfilled and update their status.

Objectives

Increase donor responsiveness through location-aware notifications.

Reduce critical delays in fulfilling urgent blood requirements.

Target Users
